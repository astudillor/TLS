# TLS
This code is supposed to further clarify the Taylor least squares (TLS) function reconstruction technique that was introduced in "Conservative Taylor least squares reconstruction with application to material point methods" by E.D. Wobbes et al. Please note that this TLS code is not coupled with MPM or any other methods.
